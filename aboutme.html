    <h1>
        About me
    </h1>
    <p> I am a very caring, determinate and responsible person who is interested in programming, graphics design and communication.
        I love learning new things and I am a very fast-learner.
        I think that my determination and the effort that I put in everything I do are the reasons of my success.</br>
        Participating at the Sky Hackathon 2018 was of my best coding experience.
        During the competition I experienced paired coding and I worked with my partners to develop an app in a very restricted time, giving me the experience of the full process of the creation of a product. </br>
        I have experienced Art and Graphics during my education in secondary school and in an advanced course in which I have took part in the 2012.
        </br> Given my passion for Graphics Design, I decided to start learning how to program with HTML and CSS.
        Once I was confident using these languages I decided to learn some back-end programming with PHP and using MySQL as the database.
        I am now focusing on using a combination of these languages to develop some projects.
        </br>I believe that programming opens your mind in way that not a lot of activities can.
        </br> I enjoy the time I spend programming and learning new methods to write code even if sometimes it’s not as easy and doesn’t go as planned. </p>
